## ASU Blackboard Scraper

### Stable as of: May 2019

<hr/>

ASU is moving away from blackboard meaning that the students will no longer have access to all their submitted assingments or class materials. ASU suggests that we download and backup these files but us juniors and seniors have taken over 30 courses via Blackboard. Therefore, downloading all these files would probably take around 5 hours...

This scraper was built to address that problem. Blackboard closes on June 30th so I do hope this scraper helps some ASU students!
